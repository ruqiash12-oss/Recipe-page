This is my solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). The goal of this challenge was to build a clean, responsive recipe page using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.

## 💡 What I learned

While building this project, I learned how to:

- Structure content semantically using headings, lists, and sections.
- Apply consistent typography using Google Fonts.
- Create responsive layouts with `grid` and `max-width`.
- Style tables using CSS Grid for better alignment.
- Use media queries to adapt the design for mobile screens.

In future projects, I want to:

- Explore accessibility features like ARIA roles and landmarks.
- Improve semantic structure for screen readers.
- Practice using CSS animations and transitions.
- Build more components using reusable styles.
